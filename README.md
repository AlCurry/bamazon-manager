###    Homework 12B - Node JS & mySQL

   Using the inquirer (for terminal prompting) and mysql (for mysql db connectivity) npm packages, create a 
   program that can serve as the product site's management utility.

    This node js program provides a
    list a set of menu options:
    View Products for Sale
    View Low Inventory
    Add to Inventory
    Add New Product

    If a manager selects View Products for Sale, the app should list every available item: the item IDs, 
    names, prices, and quantities.
    If a manager selects View Low Inventory, then it should list all items with an inventory count lower 
    than five.
    If a manager selects Add to Inventory, your app should display a prompt that will let the manager 
    "add more" of any item currently in the store.
    If a manager selects Add New Product, it should allow the manager to add a completely new product 
    to the store.

    Database schema defined in schema.sql (in bamazon-customer, hw 12A).

    Because of time constraints, most error checking and validation is not included, in a production 
    environment it would be added.
